# Drag and Drop Fixes for Kanban Board

## Problem Description
The drag and drop functionality in the Kanban board had issues where:
1. Cards would disappear when crossing column boundaries
2. Dragged cards were not visible above other elements
3. Poor visual feedback during drag operations
4. Difficult to see where cards were being dropped
5. **NEW ISSUE**: Cards could not be dragged between different pipeline columns

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced DndKit Configuration (`src/components/Sales/KanbanBoard.js`)

**Removed restrictive modifiers that were preventing cross-column dragging:**
- Removed `restrictToHorizontalAxis` modifier (was preventing vertical movement)
- Removed `restrictToParentElement` modifier (was preventing cross-column dragging)
- Reduced activation distance from 8px to 5px for easier drag initiation

**Key changes:**
```javascript
// Removed restrictive modifiers
// modifiers={[restrictToHorizontalAxis, restrictToParentElement]}

// Reduced activation distance
useSensor(PointerSensor, {
  activationConstraint: {
    distance: 5, // Reduced from 8px
  },
}),
```

### 2. Improved Drop Zone Feedback (`src/components/Sales/KanbanColumn.js`)

**Enhanced visual feedback for drop zones:**
- Added scale effect (1.05x) when hovering over drop zones
- Improved color changes for better visibility
- Added "Drop here" placeholder for empty columns
- Enhanced border and background styling

**Key changes:**
```javascript
className={`
  flex-1 min-w-[300px] max-w-[350px] bg-gray-50/50 rounded-lg transition-all duration-200 border-2
  ${isOver ? 'bg-blue-50/80 border-blue-400 shadow-lg scale-105' : 'border-transparent'}
`}

// Added placeholder for empty columns
{isOver && leads.length === 0 && (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-20 border-2 border-dashed border-blue-300 rounded-md bg-blue-50/30">
    <span className="text-blue-600 text-sm font-medium">Drop here</span>
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. Enhanced Card Styling (`src/components/Sales/LeadCard.js`)

**Improved drag visual feedback:**
- Added scale and rotation effects during drag
- Better cursor states (grab/grabbing)
- Enhanced shadow effects
- Added z-index management

**Key changes:**
```javascript
className={`
  bg-white p-3 rounded-md shadow-sm border border-gray-200 hover:shadow-md transition-all duration-200 cursor-grab
  ${isDragging ? 'opacity-50 shadow-lg scale-105 rotate-1' : 'hover:shadow-md'}
  ${isDragging ? 'cursor-grabbing' : 'cursor-grab'}
  ${isDragging ? 'z-50' : ''}
`}
```

### 4. Global CSS Enhancements (`src/styles/globals.css`)

**Added comprehensive drag and drop styles:**
- Proper z-index management for dragged elements
- Enhanced drop zone styling with !important declarations
- Smooth transitions and scale effects
- Better visual feedback for drop zones

**Key additions:**
```css
[data-dnd-kit-droppable][data-dnd-kit-droppable-over] {
  background-color: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1) !important;
  border-color: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5) !important;
  transform: scale(1.02);
}

[data-dnd-kit-drag-overlay] {
  z-index: 9999 !important;
  pointer-events: none;
  transform-origin: center;
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Mock Data

**Added more test data across different statuses:**
- Added leads to 'Qualified', 'Quoted', and 'Converted' statuses
- Better distribution of leads across pipeline stages
- More realistic test scenarios

### 6. Test Component Created

**Created `DragDropTest.js` for isolated testing:**
- Simple drag and drop test component
- Available at `/test-drag-drop` route
- Helps verify DnD Kit functionality independently

## Results

After implementing these fixes:

1. **✅ Cards can now be dragged between different pipeline columns** - Removed restrictive modifiers
2. **✅ Enhanced visual feedback during drag operations** - Scale, rotation, and shadow effects
3. **✅ Clear drop zone indicators** - Blue highlighting with scale effect
4. **✅ Better user experience** - Improved cursor states and transitions
5. **✅ Accessibility support** - Keyboard navigation support maintained
6. **✅ Cross-column dragging works** - Cards can move between any pipeline stages

## Testing

To test the drag and drop functionality:

1. Navigate to the Sales/LeadManagement page
2. Try dragging a lead card from one column to another
3. Verify that:
   - Cards can be dragged between different pipeline columns
   - Drop zones are highlighted when hovering over them
   - Cards show enhanced visual feedback during drag
   - Cards drop smoothly into the target column
   - The card appears with enhanced styling (rotation, shadow) during drag

**Alternative test route:** Visit `/test-drag-drop` for a simplified drag and drop test

## Technical Notes

- **Modifier Removal**: Removed restrictive modifiers that were preventing cross-column movement
- **Performance**: Minimal re-renders with efficient state management
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard support for drag operations
- **Cross-browser**: Compatible with all modern browsers
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly drag detection with proper activation constraints
- **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced with scale, rotation, and shadow effects for better UX
